%DEPTH_IN_METERS_CITYSCAPES_STEREOSCOPIC_INPAINTING  Compute denoised and
%complete depth map in meters from provided Cityscapes disparity map, left and
%right RGB image of stereo pair and relevant camera parameters, using the method
%proposed in the Stereoscopic Inpainting paper combined with SLIC for
%segmentation and a novel objective for segment matching.
%
%   INPUTS:
%
%   -|input_disparity|: matrix of uint16 format with same resolution as
%   Cityscapes RGB images.
%
%   -|left_image|: left image of stereo pair, the depth of which is being
%   processed, in double format.
%
%   -|left_image_uint8|: left image of stereo pair, the depth of which is being
%   processed, in uint8 format.
%
%   -|right_image|: right image of stereo pair in double format. This image is
%   auxiliary.
%
%   -|camera_parameters_file|: full path to JSON file where camera parameters
%   are stored.
%
%   OUTPUTS:
%
%   -|depth_map_in_meters|: matrix of double format containing depth in meters.
%   It may contain erroneous parts that are known to be such: they correspond to
%   SLIC segments with bad result from Stereoscopic Inpainting and assume zero
%   values at some parts of the segments.
%
%   -|is_depth_invalid|: boolean matrix, where true indicates that the
%   corresponding pixel in |depth_map_in_meters| certainly contains a erroneous
%   value.
