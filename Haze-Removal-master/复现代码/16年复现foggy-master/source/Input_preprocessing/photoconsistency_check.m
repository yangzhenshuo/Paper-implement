%PHOTOCONSISTENCY_CHECK  Check consistency of disparity map for the left image
%of a stereo pair with respect to the photometric distance between corresponding
%pixels from left and right image under this disparity map.
%
%   INPUTS:
%
%   -|left_image|: |height|-by-|width|-by-3 left RGB image of the stereo pair.
%
%   -|right_image|: |height|-by-|width|-by-3 right RGB image of the stereo pair.
%
%   -|left_disparity|: |height|-by-|width| disparity map for |left_image|, where
%   disparity is measured in pixels.
%
%   -|epsilon|: positive scalar, acting as a threshold for photometric
%   discrepancy between corresponding pixels.
%
%   OUTPUTS:
%
%   -|photoconsistency_mask|: |height|-by-|width| boolean matrix, where true
%   indicates that the corresponding pixel in |left_disparity| contains a
%   photoconsistent value.

[height, width, ~] = size(left_image);

% Create a pixel-wise map from the left to the right image, based on the
% disparity map of the left image. Enforce mapping of every pixel inside the
% image border, but remember all exceptions to mark them as inconsistent
% subsequently.

mapped_inside_border = X_aligned >= 1 | X_aligned <= width;
X_aligned = min(max(X_aligned, 1), width);

% Form warped version of right image, which is used in the photoconsistency
% check with the left image.

right_image_warped = cat(3, right_image(indices_reshaped),...
    right_image(indices_reshaped + height * width),...
    right_image(indices_reshaped + 2 * height * width));

% Consistent disparity values are equivalent to small photometric discrepancies
% between corresponding pixels AND no mapping outside the border of the right
% image.
