# Single-Image-Dehazing-Four-Methods
On the one hand, this project used two classic algorithm of contrast enhancement, homomorphic filtering and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization to accomplish the task of image dehazing. On the other hand, from the perspective of degradation model, this project used two methods based on Dark Channel Prior algorithm.
